"""anepali_charmap.py -- derive a font's OWN key->Unicode layout from anepali.com.

THE PROBLEM
-----------
`lyric-video-remotion`'s `--legacy-font` path can only transcode lyrics into a
font whose ASCII key layout is one of the five npttf2utf knows (Preeti,
Sagarmatha, Kantipur, PCS NEPALI, FONTASY_HIMALI_TT). The 15 fonts in `01
Fonts` were surveyed: all of them are LEGACY, and anepali lists 200+ more.
Rendering Allare with `ams.manthan.ttf` and Preeti keys produces exactly the
failure this tool exists to fix -- glyphs collapsed onto each other and
literal `==` where the danda should be, because AMS Manthan does not speak
Preeti at all. FONTS.md says plainly that "which layout the other fonts speak
has not been established".

WHY THIS SOLVES IT WITHOUT GUESSING
-----------------------------------
A legacy font file cannot tell you its own encoding: it has no Devanagari
cmap and no GSUB, so nothing inside it records what `;` was meant to be.
Inferring it from glyph outlines is unreliable -- the repo already records
that a visual transcription of a key map was shown to be wrong
(द/ध, श/ष confusion).

anepali.com publishes the answer. Every font page renders a character table
where each cell is a KEY, drawn in that font, under a Devanagari category
heading. The category order is the same on every page.

So the map is read, not inferred:

  1. Fetch the PREETI page. Its keys are ground truth -- npttf2utf knows what
     every Preeti key means. That fixes the SLOT ORDER: "the 14th consonant
     slot is श" is read off Preeti, not assumed.
  2. Fetch any other font page and read ITS keys in that same slot order.
     Different keys, same meanings.

Step 1 is verified rather than trusted. calibrate_slots.py checks that every
Preeti slot decodes to a DISTINCT Devanagari character with no collisions;
measured 36/36 consonants, 13/13 vowels, 10/10 numbers. If that ever stops
holding the site has changed and this tool refuses to guess.

Usage:
    py scripts/anepali_charmap.py ams-manthan
    py scripts/anepali_charmap.py ams-manthan --font "E:\\...\\ams.manthan.ttf"
    py scripts/anepali_charmap.py --list
