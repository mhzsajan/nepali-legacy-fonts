"""passthrough.py -- find every character the transcoder sends through UNMAPPED.

THE BUG THIS FINDS
------------------
`layout_encoder._cmap_keys` is documented as "greedy longest-first char-map
translation; unknown chars pass through". That fallback is the reason a
legacy render shows stray glyphs instead of a clean word.

A legacy font has ZERO Devanagari codepoints. So when an unmapped
Devanagari character is passed through to the key stream:

  1. the font has no glyph for it, so
  2. Chromium falls back to a DIFFERENT font for that character alone.

The result is one word rendered in two typefaces, with a visible seam --
and because the fallback font is a normal Unicode Devanagari font, the
character draws as itself rather than as a blank. Which means a stray
glyph is not obvious at a glance: it reads as "some letter", and the
person watching assumes the layout is just busy.

Two things make it look like the *font* is wrong rather than the map:

  * The stray character is often ASCII-looking. In a legacy font the ASCII
    range holds Devanagari glyphs, but a Devanagari character that FELL
    THROUGH is not a key at all -- it is a codepoint with no meaning in this
    font. Whether it draws as a "0", an "O", or a box depends entirely on
    what the fallback font has, which is why the symptom looks random.
  * --letter-anim wraps every letter in its own span, so each unmapped
    character is isolated and gets its own fallback instead of being
    absorbed by a neighbour.

THE FIX
-------
A passthrough is never correct here. It should be a hard error naming the
character and the word, so the map gets fixed rather than shipped.

This script lists every unmapped character in a real .lrc, with counts and
the words it affects, plus the keys that DO exist for the same sound where
that is knowable (nukta forms, for instance).
